### Hello there!

My name's William! I'm a student and amateur developer with experience in Python, JS, C++, Swift, and Java.


I make bots for Discord and I love to be a part of the amazing developer communities there. I'm also a programmer for the VEX Robotics Competition, team number is 229V, Ace Robotics!


Feel free to add me on Discord (my username is SunkenSplash) or [join my development server](https://discord.gg/nSPQsNBR3V) to see some of the projects I'm working on!


Open to collaborate, send me a DM!


Hope you have an amazing day :)
