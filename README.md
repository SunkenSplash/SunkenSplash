### Hello there!

My name's William! I'm a student and amateur developer with experience in Python, JS, C++, and Java.


I mostly make bots for Discord and love to be a part of the amazing developer communities there. I'm also a programmer for the VEX Robotics Competition, team number is 2733J, Jelly!


Feel free to add me on Discord (my username is SunkenSplashGaming#4953) or [join my development server](https://discord.gg/nSPQsNBR3V) to see some of the projects I'm working on!


Open to collaborate, send me a DM!


Hope you have an amazing day :)
